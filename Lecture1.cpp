//In our first lecture, we learned why C++ is great for studying data structures:

//Efficiency: It's fast and handles heavy tasks well.
// Strong Abstraction: It supports complex structures with features like classes.
// STL: The Standard Template Library has useful pre-made structures and algorithms.
// Compile-Time Checks: It catches errors early, making code more reliable.
