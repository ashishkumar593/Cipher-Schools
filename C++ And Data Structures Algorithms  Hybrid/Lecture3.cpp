// In this lecture, we covered the basics of variables, constants, and data types in C++:

// Variables: These are used to store data that can change during program execution.
// Constants: These hold data that cannot change once set.
// Data Types: These define the kind of data a variable or constant can hold, like integers, floating-point numbers, and characters.
